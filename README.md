## üîç Dataset Overview

The project involves two datasets: **Pizza Sales** and **Pizza Ingredients**. 

- The **Pizza Sales Dataset** comprises 48,620 entries, each detailing an individual sale. This includes information such as `pizza_id` (a unique identifier for the sale), `order_id` (linking to a specific order), `pizza_name_id` (a unique identifier for each pizza), `quantity` (number of pizzas sold), `order_date` and `order_time` (when the sale occurred), `unit_price` and `total_price` (pricing details), as well as `pizza_size` and `pizza_category` (size and type of pizza). This dataset offers a thorough view of sales, covering pricing, timing, and pizza characteristics. 

- The **Pizza Ingredients Dataset** consists of 518 entries that describe the ingredients for various pizzas. It includes `pizza_name_id` (a unique identifier for each pizza), `pizza_name` (name of the pizza), `pizza_ingredients` (list of ingredients), and `Items_Qty_In_Grams` (the quantity of each ingredient used). This dataset provides detailed insights into the composition of each pizza and the amounts of ingredients required.

- **Removing Inconsistent Data**:
  - Checked for format consistency and valid ranges.
  - Fixed inconsistencies, such as standardizing text and correcting typos.

- **Handling Outliers**:
  - Identified outliers using statistical methods or visualizations.
  - Removed, transformed, or categorized outliers based on their impact.

### II. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** discovers patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data.

### III. Sales Prediction

Sales Prediction involves **Time Series Forecasting**, a technique used to predict future values based on historical data collected over time. The process includes the following steps:

#### i) Feature Engineering

Created new variables from the raw sales data to improve the model‚Äôs performance, such as:

- **Day of the Week**: Extracted the day of the week from the sales date to capture weekly variations.
- **Month**: Extracted the month from the sales date to account for monthly trends and seasonal patterns.
- **Holiday Effects**: Identified and included features for holidays or special events that can impact sales patterns.

#### ii) Model Selection

Model Selection involves choosing the most suitable forecasting model for our sales data:

- [__ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)__](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.ARIMA.html): Captures trends and autocorrelations in non-seasonal data.
- [__SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)__](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html): Extends ARIMA to handle seasonality.

#### iii) Model Training

Model Training involves fitting the chosen model to historical sales data:

- Split the data into training and test sets to evaluate model performance. 
- Trained the model on the training set by adjusting parameters to minimize prediction errors.
- Optimized model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation or grid search.

### iv) üìä Model Evaluation

### Pizza Sales by Week

- This process begins by aggregating pizza sales on a weekly basis, converting the `order_date` to a datetime format for accurate grouping.
- The data is then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to prepare for model evaluation.
- The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) function is defined to assess model performance by comparing actual and predicted values.

#### ARIMA Model Tuning

- The ARIMA model is tuned using a grid search over specified values of p, d, and q parameters to find the optimal configuration.
- The model forecasts sales for the test set, and the best MAPE score and corresponding parameters are printed.
- The predicted values are formatted for display, allowing for easy comparison with actual sales.
- Finally, a line plot visualizes the actual vs. predicted weekly sales, helping to evaluate the ARIMA model's forecasting performance.

#### Best SARIMA Model Training and Output

- The SARIMA model is trained with orders (1, 1, 1) for ARIMA and seasonal components.
- It forecasts sales for the test set, calculating the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for accuracy assessment.
- The best MAPE score is printed to evaluate model performance.
- Predictions are formatted for easy comparison with actual sales.
- A line plot visualizes actual vs. predicted weekly sales, aiding in performance evaluation.

#### Prophet Model Forecasting
- The order_date column is converted to datetime format and renamed to 'ds' for dates and 'y' for target values.
- The Prophet model is fitted to the prepared data, with US country holidays included for enhanced accuracy.
- Future dates for the next 7 days are generated to predict sales.
- The forecast results are displayed using Prophet's built-in plotting functionality.

#### LSTM Model for Weekly Sales
- Weekly sales data is aggregated and split into training (80%) and test sets, then normalized using MinMaxScaler.
- Sequences are created for LSTM input, and an LSTM model is trained to predict sales.
- The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is calculated to evaluate the model's accuracy.
- A plot compares actual vs. predicted weekly sales, assessing the LSTM model's performance.
